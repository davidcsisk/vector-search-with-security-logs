1. Benign DNS Query Log Entry Example

Benign DNS queries are typically for regular websites or services that a user would access, such as popular websites, cloud services, or content distribution networks.
Example:

json

{
  "timestamp": "2024-10-16T10:15:23Z",
  "src_ip": "192.168.1.10",
  "query": "www.example.com",
  "query_type": "A",
  "response_code": "NOERROR",
  "response_ip": "93.184.216.34",
  "response_time": "35ms"
}

Explanation:

    timestamp: The time the DNS query was made.
    src_ip: The source IP address of the device making the request (e.g., a user's machine).
    query: The domain being queried, in this case, a well-known, legitimate website (www.example.com).
    query_type: The type of DNS record being requested. "A" record means the query is asking for the IPv4 address of the domain.
    response_code: "NOERROR" indicates a successful DNS response.
    response_ip: The IP address returned for the domain (93.184.216.34).
    response_time: How long it took for the DNS query to be resolved.

2. Malicious DNS Query Log Entry Example

Malicious DNS queries often involve domains used for phishing, command and control (C2) servers, or other malicious activities. These domains may look suspicious, have strange patterns, or be newly registered.
Example:

json

{
  "timestamp": "2024-10-16T10:16:45Z",
  "src_ip": "192.168.1.15",
  "query": "random-malicious-domain.xyz",
  "query_type": "A",
  "response_code": "NXDOMAIN",
  "response_ip": "",
  "response_time": "5ms"
}

Explanation:

    timestamp: The time the DNS query was made.
    src_ip: The source IP address of the device making the request. This could be a compromised machine or an attackerâ€™s device.
    query: The domain being queried (random-malicious-domain.xyz). This domain may be associated with malware or phishing.
    query_type: The type of DNS record being requested (in this case, an "A" record for the IPv4 address).
    response_code: "NXDOMAIN" means the domain does not exist. Many malicious domains are short-lived, or they could be takedown targets.
    response_ip: In this case, no IP is returned, as the domain does not exist.
    response_time: The query was resolved quickly, but the domain does not exist.

Key Differences:

    Benign DNS Queries usually query well-known or frequently accessed domains (e.g., example.com, google.com), return a valid IP address, and have a NOERROR response code.
    Malicious DNS Queries often involve unusual or recently registered domains that may be used for malware C2, phishing, or data exfiltration, and can return NXDOMAIN or fail to resolve entirely.

These examples illustrate the difference between normal and potentially harmful DNS traffic. In a real-world scenario, additional context, such as patterns of activity, reputation of the queried domain, or correlation with known threats, would be necessary to classify a DNS query as malicious with certainty.
